# Miscellaneous Examples #
## Difference between using term and eshell ##
All eshell terminals are run by Emacs (single-process). Each bash emulator, however, is run as a different process. This can matter, for example, when running the command _sl_ (steam locomotive) using multi_run:

## Different delay commands ##
The following video shows the difference between the two delay commands by playing some music using the _play_ command. If you pause the video at 1 second, you can see the _select-notes_ function that is run with multi-run. Expect some abrupt sound changes.

## Running on Stampede Supercomputing cluster ##
I was running some experiments on the Stampede supercomputing cluster on up to 128 nodes. Because of the limited resources, my script wasn't able to run successfully. It was hard to debug because the script would run in their batch scheduling environment. In the interest of time, I decided to manually run them in the terminal. The following video shows one run of the program on 64 terminals:

## Game Idea ##
I like the idea of using games to illustrate a concept. More on this later.
